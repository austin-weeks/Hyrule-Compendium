# Pacer Code Test

### Hey Pacer folks ðŸ‘‹!


## The App - Hyrule Compendium Dashboard
I chose to build a dashboard that displays in-game items from the most recent *The Legend of Zelda* games: *Breath of the Wild* and *Tears of the Kindgom*.

You can view the app via the [GitHub Pages]() site, or by running the app locally.

To run locally, download or clone the repo, install dependencies, and run a preview of the app with Vite.
```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run preview
```

## API
The app fetches data from the open-source [Hyrule Compendium API](https://github.com/gadhagod/Hyrule-Compendium-API), which provides information for in-game items and regions from *Breath of the Wild* and *Tears of the Kingdom*.

## Design
I went with a fairly clean/professional UI design for the app, as I've already built a similar application with a more outside-the-box design, (see, [OSRS Stock App](https://austin-weeks.github.io/osrs-ge-app)).
