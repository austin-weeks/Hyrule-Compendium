## API
The app fetches data from the open-source [Hyrule Compendium API](https://gadhagod.github.io/Hyrule-Compendium-API), which provides information for in-game items and regions from *Breath of the Wild*. The API has excellent documentation and is very easy to work with.

## UI Design
I went with a clean/minimalist design for the app. I've already built a similar project with a more out-there design, (see, [OSRS Stock App](https://austin-weeks.github.io/osrs-ge-app)), so this was a nice change of pace.

The app uses components from [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) and is styled with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com).

## Features
- Smooth Page Transitions
- Dark Mode Support
- Pagination
- Search

## Areas for Improvement

I'm not fully satisfied with my use of pagination for the category pages. If I were to work on the app further, I would probably implement a continuous scroll feature instead.
